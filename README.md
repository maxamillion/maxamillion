# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Adam Miller, this is my tiny corner of GitHub.

## About Me
I am a loving husband and father. I am an [Open Source](https://opensource.org/) and [Linux](https://kernel.org/) nerd.

I'm a Distinguished Engineer at [Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com), and currently a member of [OpenShift AI](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/openshift-ai) Engineering Leadership.

In the past, I've had a few roles throughout Red Hat since I first joined in early 2012. I was a member of the [Ansible](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/management/ansible) Engineering Leadership Team and a member of the [Ansible Core](https://github.com/ansible/ansible) Engineering Team. Prior to that I was a member of the Fedora Engineering Team (now known as [Community Linux Engineering Team](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/cle/)) where I served on the [Fedora](https://fedoraproject.org/) [Release Engineering Team](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/infra/release_guide/), the [Fedora Engineering Steering Committee](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fesco/), and the [Fedora Infrastructure](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Infrastructure) team. My first job at Red Hat was as the Release Engineer for the original [OpenShift](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift) Online service.

I have a long history of contributing to open source including, but not limited to, projects such as [Fedora](https://fedoraproject.org/) [1](https://badges.fedoraproject.org/user/maxamillion), [Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible), [CentOS](https://centos.org/), and [Ramalama](https://github.com/containers/ramalama).

I've been a [Python](https://www.python.org/) developer for multiple decades and remains my favorite programming language to this day, but I also enjoy developing in [Go](https://go.dev/).

My primary areas of focus, expertise, and passion reside around operating systems, infrastructure, automation, containers, information security, and cloud computing.

I am currently the Chair of the [Linux Founation AI & Data](https://lfaidata.foundation/) [MLOps Committee](https://lfaidata.foundation/projects/mlops-committee/).

Red Hat means something to me, I take a lot of pride in working for a company that believes in and understands Open Source Software at it's core as well as being a part of an open source project that excites a vibrant community as much as it excites me. I'm extremely passionate about open source software and it is genuinely a large part of why I wake up in the morning. I live for this stuff, it's a part of me, and it's why I have Red Hat Shadowman and Ansible tattoos on my person.

I go by `maxamillion` in most areas of the nerd web and can often be found there. For communications I'm `maxamillion@one.ems.host` on Matrix and `@maxamillion@fosstodon.org` on Mastodon.
