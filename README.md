# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Adam Miller, I am an [Open Source](https://opensource.org/) and [Linux](https://kernel.org/) nerd. This is my tiny corner of the GitHub.

## About Me
I am a loving husband and father, an open source fanatic.

I'm a Distinguished Engineer at [Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com), and currently a member of [OpenShift AI](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/openshift-ai) Engineering Leadership. Previously I was a member of the [Ansible](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/management/ansible) Engineering Leadership.

I have a long history of contributing to open source including but not limited to projects such as [Fedora](https://fedoraproject.org/) [1](https://badges.fedoraproject.org/user/maxamillion), [Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible), [CentOS](https://centos.org/), and [Ramalama](https://github.com/containers/ramalama).

Red Hat means something to me, I take a lot of pride in working for a company that believes in and understands Open Source Software at it's core as well as being a part of an open source project that excites a vibrant community as much as it excites me. I'm extremely passionate about open source software and it is genuinely a large part of why I wake up in the morning. I live for this stuff, it's a part of me, and it's why I have Red Hat Shadowman and Ansible tattoos on my person.

I go by `maxamillion` in most areas of the nerd web and can often be found there. For communications I'm `maxamillion@one.ems.host` on Matrix and `@maxamillion@fosstodon.org` on Mastodon.
